## 📥 Quick Start Setup

**1. Clone the Repository & Environment**

**2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Configure Settings**
We don't hardcode variables. Everything is managed in a central settings file. Copy the template to get started:
```bash
cp settings-template.ini settings.ini
```

**4. Generate Security Keys**
Because OST encrypts all network traffic, you must generate a pair of cryptographic keys before streaming.
```bash
python keygen.py
```
*Copy the terminal output and paste it at the bottom of new `settings.ini` file.*

## 🚀 Running the Suite

Ensure your hardware is plugged in and your `settings.ini` has the correct COM ports and IPs defined.

**Start the Hardware Capture:**
```bash
python stream.py
```

**Watch the Live Feed:**
*(Open a new terminal or run on a different computer)*
```bash
python view.py
```

**Analyze Recorded Data:**
```bash
streamlit run studio.py
```
